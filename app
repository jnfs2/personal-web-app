        <p>Hi my name is Jennifer! I enjoy reading, browsing the internet, and playing games in my spare time. I'm not sure what career field I want to pursue in the future, but for tech, I would like to try something related to sciene and engineering. For instance, bioengineering. Computer science is also a field that interests me mostly because I enjoyed this tech course more compared to the others. Also, a lot of my friends are thinking of pursuing this program in the future, so it would be nice to join them.</p>
